> BASH script to install (g)vim just the way I like

Clones all the plugins I want so they can be loaded with pathogen and builds a .vimrc file.

To run it:

  1. clone repo
  1. run the script
      ```bash
      ./install.sh
      ```

Note: the script will `sudo apt-get` to install gvim, so you'll be prompted for your password.
